<p>Hi I am Yidi</p>
<p>I am a second year master's student at Department of Communication, Michigan State University. I advised by Dr. Brandon Van Der Heide. My research interest basically lies at the intersection of computer-mediated communication and interpersonal communication. I am typically interested in social support in the mediated environment, like human behaviors in online health communities.</p>
